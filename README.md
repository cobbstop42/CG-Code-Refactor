CG-Code-Refactor Repository

This repository contains the Horiseon refactor and accessibilty project.  The code was submitted by Horiseon for the purpose of improving the overall accessiblity of their website.  We spend a significant portion of our lives on line.  Its where we read order necessities, get news, and socialize with friends.  Approximatley 20% of the population have disabilities which make accessing the web difficult.  

The focus of this project was to update the code to meet current accessibility standards in order to reach those with certain disabilities.  Improved accessiblity was achieved by replacing regular HTML tags with Semantic HTML.  Semantic HTML improves website accessibilty for individuals who use assistive technology, such as screen readers, by providing a more literal meaning of the information on the wevbpage and web applications. The changes that were made are notated by comments on both the HTML and CSS pages.  The published page is located at http://cobbstop42.github.io/CG-Code-Refactor
