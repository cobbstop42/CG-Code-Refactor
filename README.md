# CG-Code-Refactor-Repository

This repository contains the Horiseon improved accessibility project.  The code was submitted by Horiseon for the purpose of improbing the overall accessibility of the website.

## Motivation for this project
We spend a significant portion of our lives on line.  It is where we order neccessities, get information, and socialize with friends.  Approximatley 20% of the population have disabilities which make accessing the internet difficult.  The focus of this project was to update the code of the website to meet current accessibility standards in an attempt to reach those individuals with certain physical challenges.

## How accessibility was improved
Improved accessibility was achieved by replacing regular HTML tags with Semantic HTML.  Semantic HTML improves website accessibility for individuals who use assistive technology, such as screen readers, by provding a more literal meaning of the information on the webpage and web applications.  The changes that were made are notated by the comments on both the HTML and CSS  pages.
