CG-Code-Refactor Repository

This repository contains the Horiseon refactor and accessibilty project.  The code was submitted by Horiseon for the purpose of improving the overall accessiblity of their website.  The focus was to update the code to meet current accessibility standards and improve the overall flow of the current HTML and CSS code. Improved accessiblity was achieved by replacing regular HTML tags with Semantic HTML.  Semantic HTML improves website accessibilty for individuals who use assistive technology, such as screen readers, by providing a more literal meaning of the information on the wevbpage and web applications. The changes that were made are notated by comments on both the HTML and CSS pages.  The published page is located at http://cobbstop42.github.io/CG-Code-Refactor
